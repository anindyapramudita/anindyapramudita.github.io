  "My journey into frontend development began with a leap of faith during a dinner with a friend. Our discussion regarding our work made me realise that even after working for 4 years in other industries, my passion lay elsewhere.";
export const ABOUT_ME_CONTENT_2 =
  "Ever since I was a kid, I’m always fond of creating things. I find joy in turning abstract ideas into tangible realities. It was something that I was missing in my adulthood. Until finally, I decided that I can still make that happen in development.";
export const ABOUT_ME_CONTENT_3 =
  "It wasn’t an easy task, doing an intensive full-stack developer bootcamp while still doing a full-time job. But every challenge felt worthwhile as I rekindled the love for creation I'd been missing. Two years of continuous learning and hard work later, I proudly stand as a frontend developer, where every line of code echoes the authenticity of a journey driven by genuine enthusiasm and a love for creating something meaningful.";
